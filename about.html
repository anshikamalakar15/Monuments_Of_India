    <h1>MAJESTY MONUMENTS OF INDIA</h1>
    <h3>
      India is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and is best
      known for its colourful culture and fascinating heritage. Its grand
      monuments, like the Taj Mahal act as strong pillars of the rich and deep
      history that India possesses. From their splendid architecture to a strong
      legacy, the historical monuments of India speak volumes. Most of these
      Indian monuments were primarily built under the regime of Rajputana,
      Dravidian and Mughal emperors. The monuments of India are speaking stones
      of the glory of its rulers and the brilliance of artisans in ancient
      India. Due to the incredible beauty of India and the constant efforts of
      the government in maintaining the heritage sites, India tourism has
      flourished rapidly witnessing an increase in the number of travellers from
      all around the world. Some of the well-preserved monuments in the
      different parts of the country are Red Fort (North), Sun Temple Konark
      (East), Amer Fort (West) and Charminar (South).

    <h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1>
    <h3>
      An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648
      by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife,
      the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the
      universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.The Taj Mahal is
      located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that
      encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It
      was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal
      with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the
      mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer
      courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653
      AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in
      Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For
      its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters,
      calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from
      the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran.
      Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal
      is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole
      range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty
      has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and
      light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic
      aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and
      blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods.
      The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones
      make it a monument apart.

    <h1>GATEWAY OF INDIA</h1>
    <h3>
      The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in
      Bombay, India. The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King
      George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in
      1911.The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in
      the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Gujarati
      architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet
      was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The
      structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet)
      high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as
      Gujarati architecture of the time. Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the
      foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911. The
      structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The final
      design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the
      monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic
      ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay.
      It served to allow entry and access to India. The Gateway of India is
      located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chhatrapati
      Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument
      has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city's
      top tourist attraction.

    <h1>HAWA MAHAL</h1>
    <h3>
      Jaipur’s exquisite Hawa Mahal, the 18th-century Palace of Winds is a
      rose-tinted example of the Pink City’s architectural splendour. However,
      as popular a visual the lattice windowed façade might be, there is still
      much about this 87-ft tall monument that many don’t know. (Photo Source:
      Wikimedia Commons, Ronakshah 1990) The majestic Hawa Mahal, or the Palace
      of Winds, is often the first visual that comes to mind when one thinks of
      the Rajasthan's capital of Jaipur. The ‘pink city’, as Jaipur is popularly
      known, presents a beautiful marriage of history, heritage and
      architectural splendour, with the rose-tinted sandstone Hawa Mahal
      standing tall among one of the most visited and unique monuments. However,
      not many know that the 300-plus jharokhas (portholes) that form the very
      memorable façade of the monument that attracts tens of thousands of
      tourists from around the world each year, is actually its back side.
      Moreover, even the front façade doesn’t serve as a direct entrance, and
      one has to enter from the side of the City Palace, of which it is a part.
      Located in Badi Chaupar (large square), in Jaipur’s Old Town, the
      impressive Hawa Mahal is highly regarded as an architectural marvel and
      has even been called ‘the standing vision of joyous poetry’ in an ode by
      I.K. Sharma, highly regarded as a pioneer of English poetry from
      Rajasthan.

    <h1>AGRA FORT</h1>
    <h3>
      Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the
      main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty till 1638, when the
      capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. The Agra fort is a UNESCO World
      Heritage site.It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister
      monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a
      walled city. After the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, the victorious
      Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a
      baoli in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He
      was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with
      the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri’s general,
      Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi
      where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad. Sheesh Mahal, Agra
      Fort:The effect produced by lighting candles in Sheesh Mahal, Agra Fort.
      Realising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his
      capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded
      that this was a brick fort known as ‘Badalgarh’. It was in a ruined
      condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area
      Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was
      built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces.
      Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in
      1573. It was only during the reign of Akbar’s grandson, Shah Jahan, that
      the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj
      Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather,
      Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. He destroyed
      some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own. At the end
      of his life, Shah Jahan was deposed and restrained by his son, Aurangzeb,
      in the fort. It is rumoured that Shah Jahan died in Muasamman Burj, a
      tower with a marble balcony with a view of the Taj Mahal. The fort was
      invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century.
      Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many
      times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad
      Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next
      decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the
      Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War.

      The Golden temple is located in the holy city of the Sikhs, Amritsar. The
      Golden temple is famous for its full golden dome, it is one of the most
      sacred pilgrim spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built on a 67-ft square of
      marble and is a two storied structure. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had the upper
      half of the building built with approximately 400 kg of gold leaf. The
      Golden Temple is surrounded by a number of other famous temples like the
      Durgiana Temple. The fourth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Ram Das, who had initially
      constructed a pool here, founded Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple
      or Harmandir Sahib. It is here that Sage Valmiki wrote the epic, Ramayana.
      Rama and Sita are believed to have spent their fourteen-year exile in
      Amritsar, the epicenter of Sikhism. To the south of the temple is a
      garden, and the tower of Baba Atal. The Central Sikh Museum is atop the
      Clock Tower. The ‘Guru Ka Langar’ offers free food to around 20,000 people

      or Eternal Throne in the night. The Akal Takht also houses the ancient
      weapons used by the Sikh warriors. Guru Hargobind established it. The
      rugged old Jubi Tree in the north west corner of the compound is believed
      to possess special powers. It was planted 450 years ago, by the Golden
      Temple’s first high priest, Baba Buddha. .

    <h1>INDIA GATE</h1>
    <h3>
      India gate or The All India War Memorial is 42-metre-high giant gate made
      up of sandstone, built by prominent war memorial architect Edwin Lutyens
      in 1921. It is a war memorial situated at the eastern end of Kingsway that
      is the Rajpath, is memorial to martyrs of World War (1914-21). During the
      liberation period of Bangladesh, a structure comprising of a black marble
      plinth along with reversed L1A1 rifle, capped by a war helmet surrounded
      by four urns igniting the permanent light was constructed under the India
      gate. This structure is called the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It was inaugurated
      during the 23rd Republic day by the then prime minister Indira Gandhi in
      1972. Since then Amar jawan Jyoti has been serving as a gravestone
      dedicated to the known or unknown Indian martyrs, who lost their lives
      while defending the nation. The names of more than 13,000 Indian martyrs
      are inscribed on the monuments. The present government is planning to
      build national war memorial near the India gate canopy which recently
      underwent the removal of George V statue which was later shifted to the
      coronation garden.

    <h1>VICTORIA MEMORIAL</h1>
    <h3>
      he Victoria Memorial Hall is one of the most magnificent monuments of not
      only the city of Calcutta but of our entire country. Representing the
      resplendent and majestic British architecture, Victoria Memorial Hall
      stands today, as a veritable icon of the city of Kolkata. Located on 1
      Queen’s way, the VMH was envisaged by Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of British
      India, as a memorial to the deceased Queen Victoria. Hence, according to
      Curzon this memorial should take form of a great marble hall, which was to
      be erected on the Calcutta maidan to serve primarily as a monument to the
      Queen and secondarily as a national gallery and Valhalla of the Indian
      Empire. The national gallery which Curzon speaks about would in future
      take the shape of a museum. The Victoria Memorial hall was therefore set
      up to function more than just a memorial for the deceased Queen Victoria.
      The memorial was to be designed with a museum housed within its realms.
      The memorial with the museum would act as a “standing record of our
      wonderful history” This was to be a historical museum where people could
      see before them pictures and statues of men who played a prominent part in
      the history of this country and develop a pride in their past. Curzon’s
      writing bring forth that it was a part of his imperial duty to put into
      execution to set up a “Great Imperial memorial worthy of Queen Victoria
      and worthy of India. Within few weeks after Queen’ death in January 1901 a
      great meeting was convened in the Town Hall of Calcutta on 6th February,
      1901, whereby a resolution for constituting an all Indian Memorial Fund
      for building of the memorial was moved. The princes and people of India
      responded Architects generously to his appeal for funds and the total cost
      of construction of this monument amounting to one crore, five lakhs of
      rupees, was entirely derived from their voluntary subscriptions. King
      George V, the then Prince of Wales, laid the foundation stone on January
      4, 1906 and it was formally opened to the public in 1921.
